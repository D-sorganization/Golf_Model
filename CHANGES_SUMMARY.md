# Golf Swing Data Generator - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix issues and improve the golf swing data generation system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 1x1 Matrix Signal Extraction Issue
**Problem**: The system was skipping 1x1 matrix signals (scalar values) like `MidpointCalcsLogs.signal7` and `RHCalcsLogs.signal2`.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m` to handle 1x1 matrices
- Added case for `num_elements == 1` to replicate scalar values across all time steps
- Updated error message to include scalar values

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m`

### 2. Animation Control Issue
**Problem**: Animation was always running in sequential mode, slowing down simulations.

**Solution**:
- Added animation control checkbox to the GUI
- Default setting: Animation disabled for speed
- Added logic to switch between accelerator mode (fast) and normal mode (with animation)
- **FIXED**: Updated `runSingleTrialWithSignalBus` function to properly use `Simulink.SimulationInput` with animation control
- **FIXED**: Added model configuration in `startGeneration` to set initial simulation mode
- **FIXED**: Enhanced stop button to properly handle model-specific stopping
- **FIXED**: Added fallback logic for licenses that don't support accelerator mode - uses normal mode with `AnimationMode` set to 'off'

**Files Modified**:
- `GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m`

### 3. Missing "Run Another Trial" Option
**Problem**: No option to run additional trials after completion.

**Solution**:
- Added "Run Another Trial" button to the GUI
- Button is enabled after trial completion
- Allows running single additional trials without restarting the entire process

**Files Modified**:
- `GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m`

### 4. Stop Button Functionality
**Problem**: Stop button didn't actually stop running simulations.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced stop button to use `set_param('GolfSwing3D_Kinetic', 'SimulationCommand', 'stop')`
- Added proper error handling for stop operations
- Improved UI state management

**Files Modified**:
- `GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m`

## New Features Added

### 1. Automatic Script Backup System
**Feature**: Automatically creates backup of all scripts before each run.

**Implementation**:
- `backupScripts()` function creates timestamped backup folders
- Backs up all 25+ supporting scripts
- Creates README file with backup information
- Integrated into `startGeneration()` function

**Files Modified**:
- `GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m`

### 2. Comprehensive Python Feature List
**Feature**: Complete machine learning feature list with all variables.

**Implementation**:
- Created `golf_swing_ml_features.py` with comprehensive feature lists
- Includes all previously missing scalar signals
- Organized features by category (kinematics, forces, inputs, etc.)
- Added utility functions for data loading and validation

**Files Created**:
- `golf_swing_ml_features.py`

## Backup System

### Current Backup Location
- `Backup_Working_State_20250802_083032/`
- Contains all original files before modifications

### Automatic Backup System
- Creates `Script_Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` folders for each run
- Includes all 25+ supporting scripts
- Creates README with backup information

## Python Machine Learning Features

### Feature Categories
1. **Target Variables** (7 features): Club head speed, angle of attack, etc.
2. **Joint Kinematics** (50+ features): Positions and velocities of all joints
3. **Forces and Torques** (30+ features): Biomechanical forces and torques
4. **Power and Work** (8 features): Calculated power and work metrics
5. **Hand Kinematics** (15+ features): Hand positions and velocities
6. **Club Properties** (10+ features): Club mass, COM, positions
7. **Moments and Couples** (12+ features): Moment of force calculations
8. **Input Parameters** (189 features): Polynomial coefficients A-G for all joints
9. **Model Configuration** (13 features): Model parameters and settings
10. **Scalar Signals** (30+ features): Previously missing 1x1 matrix signals
11. **Time Features** (1 feature): Time column for temporal analysis

### Key Scalar Signals Now Included
- `MidpointCalcsLogs_signal7`
- `RHCalcsLogs_signal2`
- All other 1x1 matrix signals from various body segments

### Utility Functions
- `discover_scalar_signals()`: Dynamically find scalar signals in data
- `validate_scalar_extraction()`: Validate proper signal extraction
- `load_golf_swing_data()`: Load and prepare data for ML

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test 1x1 Matrix Extraction
- Run a small trial (1-5 trials)
- Check that `MidpointCalcsLogs_signal7` and `RHCalcsLogs_signal2` are captured
- Verify no "size [1 1] not supported" messages

### 2. Test Animation Control
- Run with animation disabled (default) - should be fast
- Run with animation enabled - should show animation but be slower
- Verify accelerator vs normal mode switching

### 3. Test Stop Button
- Start a long trial run
- Click stop button during execution
- Verify simulation actually stops

### 4. Test Run Another Trial
- Complete a trial run
- Click "Run Another Trial" button
- Verify single trial executes properly

### 5. Test Script Backup
- Start a trial run
- Check that `Script_Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` folder is created
- Verify all scripts are backed up

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** with small trial runs
2. **Validate scalar signal extraction** using the Python validation functions
