SAFE STATE BACKUP: 1962 COLUMNS WORKING
========================================

Created: August 2, 2025 12:24:48
Git Tag: SAFE_1962_COLUMNS_WORKING

This is a stable, working state with comprehensive data extraction functionality.
Achieved 1962 columns per trial with a compiled master dataset of 1997 columns.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
✓ 1x1 scalar handling (MidpointCalcsLogs.signal7, RHCalcsLogs.signal2)
✓ 3x1xN vector handling (RFUpperCOM, etc.) - extracted as _dim1, _dim2, _dim3
✓ Unified 3x3 matrix handling (constant and time-varying) - flattened to 9 columns (_I11 to _I33)
✓ Script backup system with timestamped folders
✓ Dynamic summary updates in GUI
✓ Proper error handling and debug messages
✓ Enhanced data extraction from all sources (CombinedSignalBus, Logsout, Simscape, Workspace)

DATA EXTRACTION CAPABILITIES:
----------------------------
- Time series data (1xN, 2xN, etc.)
- 3D vectors over time (3x1xN) → 3 separate columns
- 3x3 matrices (constant and time-varying) → 9 flattened columns
- 6DOF vectors (6xN) → 6 separate columns
- 1x1 scalars → replicated across all time steps
- All matrix types treated as potentially time-varying for future-proofing

TOTAL COLUMNS CAPTURED: 1962 per trial
MASTER DATASET COLUMNS: 1997

IMPROVEMENTS FROM PREVIOUS STATE:
--------------------------------
- Additional 3 columns captured compared to 1959-column state
- Enhanced handling of edge cases and disconnected signals
- Improved data consistency across all extraction methods
- Better error handling and debug output

FILES INCLUDED:
---------------
- Data_GUI.m (main GUI script)
- setModelParameters.m (simulation parameter configuration)
- extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m (data extraction logic)
- extractConstantMatrixData.m (constant matrix handling)
- extractFromLogsout.m (Logsout data extraction)
- extractFromSimscape.m (Simscape data extraction)
- extractFromWorkspace.m (workspace data extraction)
- All supporting utility functions

RESTORATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------
To restore to this state:
1. git checkout SAFE_1962_COLUMNS_WORKING
2. Or copy all .m files from this backup folder to the main Simulation_Dataset_GUI directory

NOTES:
------
- This state represents the highest column count achieved so far
- All matrix types are properly handled with future-proofing
- Animation control has been simplified to avoid data capture issues
- Script backup system ensures reproducibility of test runs
- Dynamic GUI updates reflect actual parameter values
- Comprehensive error handling and debug output for troubleshooting

CRITICAL FILES:
--------------
- extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m: Contains the unified 3x3 matrix handling logic
- Data_GUI.m: Main GUI with script backup system and dynamic updates
- setModelParameters.m: Simplified simulation parameters for reliable data capture

This state should be preserved as a reference point for future development.
