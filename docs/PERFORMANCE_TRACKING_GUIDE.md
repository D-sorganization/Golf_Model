### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Total Session Time**: Overall GUI usage time
2. **Slowest Operation**: Primary bottleneck to address
3. **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks or inefficient allocation
4. **Operation Frequency**: Identify frequently called slow operations

## Optimization Workflow

### 1. Baseline Measurement
```matlab
% Run performance analysis to establish baseline
performance_analysis_script();
```

### 2. Identify Bottlenecks
- Look for operations >1 second average time
- Check for high memory usage patterns
- Identify frequently called slow operations

### 3. Implement Improvements
- Optimize slow algorithms
- Implement caching for frequent operations
- Reduce memory allocation/deallocation
- Use vectorization where possible

### 4. Measure Improvements
```matlab
% Re-run analysis after improvements
performance_analysis_script();
```

### 5. Compare Results
- Compare execution times before/after
- Check memory usage improvements
- Verify bottleneck resolution

## File Outputs

### Generated Files

The performance tracking system generates several types of files:

1. **Performance Reports** (`.mat` files)
   - Comprehensive performance data
   - Loadable in MATLAB for further analysis
   - Contains all timing and memory data

2. **CSV Data** (`.csv` files)
   - Tabular performance data
   - Importable into Excel or other analysis tools
   - Contains operation statistics

3. **Text Summaries** (`.txt` files)
   - Human-readable performance summaries
   - Key insights and recommendations
   - Quick reference for performance status

### File Naming Convention

Files are automatically named with timestamps:
- `performance_analysis_report_2025-01-15_14-30-25.mat`
- `performance_data_2025-01-15_14-30-25.csv`
- `performance_summary_2025-01-15_14-30-25.txt`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Tracker Not Found**
   ```matlab
   % Ensure the GUI is running and tracker is initialized
   main_fig = findobj('Name', '2D Golf Swing Analysis GUI');
   tracker = getappdata(main_fig, 'performance_tracker');
   ```

2. **Memory Function Errors**
   - The system gracefully handles memory function failures
   - Memory metrics will show as 0 if unavailable

3. **Timer Conflicts**
   - Each operation should have a unique name
   - Ensure start_timer() and stop_timer() are paired correctly

### Performance Tips

1. **Minimize Overhead**: Only track operations that matter
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear operation names help with analysis
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Check performance regularly during development
4. **Baseline Comparison**: Always compare against baseline measurements

## Integration with Development Workflow

### During Development
- Enable tracking during feature development
- Monitor performance impact of changes
- Use quick tests for iterative optimization

### Before Commits
- Run full performance analysis
- Ensure no performance regressions
- Document performance improvements

### After Deployments
- Monitor real-world performance
- Collect user performance data
- Identify optimization opportunities

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Performance Thresholds

You can modify the performance thresholds in the `performance_tracker.m` file:

```matlab
% In identify_bottlenecks method
if op_data.average_time > 1.0  % Change threshold here
    bottlenecks{end+1} = sprintf('%s: %.3f seconds average', op_name, op_data.average_time);
end

if op_data.memory_delta > 100 * 1024 * 1024  % Change memory threshold here
    bottlenecks{end+1} = sprintf('%s: High memory usage (%.2f MB)', ...
        op_name, op_data.memory_delta / 1024 / 1024);
end
```

### Adding Custom Metrics

Extend the performance tracker to include custom metrics:

```matlab
% Add custom property to tracker
obj.custom_metrics = containers.Map('KeyType', 'char', 'ValueType', 'any');

% Record custom metric
obj.custom_metrics('my_metric') = my_value;
```
