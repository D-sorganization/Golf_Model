## 🔐 Your Standalone Version is Safe

### Access the Original Standalone Version

**Via Tag (Permanent):**
```bash
git checkout v1.0-standalone
```

**Via Backup Branch:**
```bash
git checkout backup/standalone-oct29-2025
```

**Via Commit Hash:**
```bash
git checkout e655c82
```

### Return to Enhanced Main
```bash
git checkout main
```

## ✅ What Now Works

### Tabbed GUI (New!)
```matlab
cd('matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI')
launch_tabbed_app()
```
- Tab 1: Model Setup (placeholder)
- Tab 2: ZTCF Calculation (placeholder)
- Tab 3: Embedded 3D Visualization ✨

### Standalone SkeletonPlotter (Still Works!)
```matlab
% Original call - unchanged and fully functional
cd('matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI/2D GUI/visualization')
SkeletonPlotter(BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ)
```

### Python GUI Enhancements (New!)
```bash
cd "matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI/Simscape Multibody Data Plotters/Python Version/integrated_golf_gui_r0"
python golf_gui_application.py
```
- Smooth 60+ FPS playback
- Professional video export (720p-4K)

## 🧪 Testing Your New Setup

### Test 1: Tabbed GUI
```matlab
cd('matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI')
launch_tabbed_app()
```
**Expected:** Tab 3 shows embedded 3D visualization (no separate window)

### Test 2: Standalone SkeletonPlotter (Backward Compatibility)
```matlab
% Load your data
load('path/to/BASEQ.mat')
load('path/to/ZTCFQ.mat')
load('path/to/DELTAQ.mat')

% Original call - should work exactly as before
SkeletonPlotter(BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ)
```
**Expected:** Opens in standalone window (original behavior)

### Test 3: Automated Testing
```matlab
cd('matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI')
test_embedded_visualization()
```
**Expected:** 7 tests run, all should pass
