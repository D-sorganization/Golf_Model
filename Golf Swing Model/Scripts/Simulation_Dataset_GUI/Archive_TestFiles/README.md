# Simulation Dataset Generation GUI

A self-contained MATLAB GUI package for generating simulation datasets from the Golf Swing Model.

## Overview

This package provides a graphical user interface for:
- Configuring simulation parameters
- Running multiple simulation trials
- Extracting data from signal buses and Simscape blocks
- Optimizing simulation performance
- Generating training datasets for machine learning

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the GUI:**
   ```matlab
   launch_gui
   ```

2. **Test Signal Bus Compatibility:**
   ```matlab
   test_signal_bus_compatibility
   ```

3. **Configure Performance Options:**
   ```matlab
   settings = performance_options();
   ```

## Signal Bus Integration

The GUI is designed to work with your updated signal bus logging system:

### What's Working
- **Signal Bus Logging**: Your signal bus is configured and working
- **Performance Gain**: Disabling Simscape Results Explorer provides 5.1% speed improvement
- **Data Format**: GUI expects table or numeric array format (compatible with your current setup)

### Key Features
- **Performance Optimization**: Toggle Simscape Results Explorer for speed improvement
- **Signal Bus Support**: Extract data from signal buses and ToWorkspace blocks
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for logsout, signal buses, and Simscape data
- **Batch Processing**: Run multiple simulation trials with different parameters

## Performance Optimization

The GUI includes performance optimization options:

- **Disable Simscape Results Explorer**: Provides ~5% speed improvement
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces memory allocation during simulation
- **Fast Restart**: Enables faster subsequent simulations

## Data Format Compatibility

The GUI expects data in one of these formats:
1. **Table format**: MATLAB tables with named columns
2. **Numeric arrays**: Simple numeric arrays with time and position data

Your current `.mat` files are already in the correct format (tables with numeric arrays).

## Usage

1. **Configure Simulation Parameters:**
   - Set number of trials
   - Configure simulation time
   - Select data sources (signal bus, Simscape, etc.)

2. **Set Performance Options:**
   - Click "Performance Options" button
   - Configure optimization settings
   - Apply settings to model

3. **Run Simulations:**
   - Click "Generate Dataset"
   - Monitor progress
   - Review results

4. **Export Data:**
   - Data is automatically saved in compatible format
   - Files are ready for machine learning training

## Troubleshooting

### Signal Bus Issues
- Run `test_signal_bus_compatibility` to verify setup
- Ensure signal bus logging is enabled in your model
- Check that signal names are unique

### Performance Issues
- Use performance options to disable Simscape Results Explorer
- Enable memory optimization for large datasets
- Consider using Fast Restart for multiple trials

### Data Format Issues
- Verify data files are in table or numeric array format
- Check that required columns are present
- Ensure time vector is properly formatted

## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Simulink
- Simscape (for Simscape data extraction)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for data processing)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Run the compatibility test: `test_signal_bus_compatibility`
2. Check the performance options: `performance_options`
3. Verify your signal bus configuration in the Simulink model

## Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial release with signal bus support
- **v1.1**: Added performance optimization features
- **v1.2**: Enhanced compatibility testing and documentation
