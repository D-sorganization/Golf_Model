# Dataset Generation Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the `generateSimulationTrainingData.m` script to address the issues identified in the dataset evaluation.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Discrete Variables Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: All `Discrete_` variables (like `Discrete_1360171581`, `Discrete_8972771101`, etc.) were zeros, indicating unused/placeholder signals.

**Solution**: 
- Added `filterDiscreteVariables()` function that automatically detects and removes discrete variables that are all zeros
- This eliminates noise from unused signals and reduces dataset size

### 2. **Missing Segment Lengths and Inertials** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The script was not capturing critical anthropomorphic parameters from the model workspace that are essential for matching anthropomorphies to motion patterns.

**Solution**:
- Added `extractModelWorkspaceData()` function that extracts:
  - **Segment lengths**: arm_length, leg_length, torso_length, spine_length, etc.
  - **Segment masses**: arm_mass, leg_mass, torso_mass, etc.
  - **Segment inertias**: arm_inertia, leg_inertia, torso_inertia, etc.
  - **Anthropomorphic parameters**: golfer_height, golfer_weight, golfer_bmi, etc.
  - **Club parameters**: club_length, club_mass, club_inertia, etc.
  - **Joint parameters**: joint_limits, joint_stiffness, joint_damping, etc.

### 3. **Missing Rotation Matrices** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Rotation matrices were not being properly captured as individual vector components.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced all data extraction functions to properly handle multi-dimensional data:
  - `extractLogsoutData()`: Now extracts each component of rotation matrices
  - `extractSignalLogStructs()`: Handles matrix data in signal logs
  - `extractSimscapeResultsData()`: Properly processes multi-dimensional Simscape signals
- Rotation matrices are now captured as 9 individual components (3x3 matrix flattened)

### 4. **Vector Signal Handling** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: The script had basic vector handling but wasn't properly capturing all components of 3D or 9D vectors.

**Solution**:
- Improved `resampleSignal()` function to handle multi-dimensional data
- Enhanced all extraction functions to properly decompose vectors and matrices
- Added proper naming conventions for vector components (e.g., `signal_1`, `signal_2`, etc.)

## New Functions Added

### `extractModelWorkspaceData(model_name, trial_data, signal_names, num_time_points)`
- Extracts anthropomorphic parameters from model workspace
- Handles scalars, vectors, and 3x3 matrices (inertia tensors)
- Automatically detects and extracts relevant variables
- Prefixes all extracted variables with "ModelWorkspace_" for identification

### `filterDiscreteVariables(trial_data, signal_names)`
- Identifies discrete variables that start with "Discrete_"
- Checks if all values are zero
- Removes zero discrete variables from both data and signal names
- Provides detailed logging of filtering process

## Enhanced Functions

### `extractLogsoutData()`
- Now properly handles multi-dimensional data
- Extracts each component of rotation matrices and vectors
- Improved error handling and logging

### `extractSignalLogStructs()`
- Enhanced to handle matrix data in signal logs
- Properly decomposes rotation matrices into individual components
- Better handling of different data types

### `extractSimscapeResultsData()`
- Improved multi-dimensional data handling
- Better rotation matrix extraction
- Enhanced signal naming for vector components

## Data Structure Improvements

### Model Workspace Data
All anthropomorphic parameters are now captured as time-invariant constants:
- Scalar values are repeated for all time points
- Vector values are decomposed into individual components
- 3x3 matrices (inertia tensors) are flattened to 9 components

### Rotation Matrix Handling
Rotation matrices are now properly captured:
- 3x3 rotation matrices → 9 individual components
- Each component is resampled to the target time vector
- Proper naming convention: `original_name_1`, `original_name_2`, ..., `original_name_9`

### Discrete Variable Filtering
- Automatic detection and removal of unused discrete signals
- Reduces dataset noise and size
- Maintains data integrity by only removing truly unused signals

## Expected Dataset Improvements

### Before Improvements:
- Missing critical anthropomorphic parameters
- All discrete variables were zeros (noise)
- Rotation matrices not properly captured
- Limited vector handling

### After Improvements:
- Complete anthropomorphic parameter capture
- Clean dataset with no zero discrete variables
- Full rotation matrix capture (9 components each)
- Comprehensive vector and matrix handling
- Better data organization and naming

## Usage

The improved script works exactly the same way as before:
```matlab
generateSimulationTrainingData()
```

The script will now automatically:
1. Extract all model workspace parameters
2. Filter out unused discrete variables
3. Properly capture rotation matrices and vectors
4. Generate comprehensive CSV files with all relevant data

## Validation

To validate the improvements:
1. Run the script with a small number of trials
2. Check that the generated CSV files contain:
   - ModelWorkspace_* columns with anthropomorphic data
   - No Discrete_* columns with all zeros
   - Proper rotation matrix components (9 columns per matrix)
   - All vector components properly decomposed

## File Structure

The improved script maintains the same file structure:
- Individual CSV files for each trial
- Performance logs and summaries
- Comprehensive data tables with all extracted information

## Compatibility

The improvements are fully backward compatible:
- Same function interface
- Same configuration options
- Same output format
- Enhanced data content without breaking existing workflows
