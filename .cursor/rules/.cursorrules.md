# Cursor Development Rules for Golf Model Project

## Project Structure and Organization

### File Organization
- **MATLAB files** (.m, .slx, .mdl, .mat) should be stored in the `matlab/` directory
- **Python files** should be stored in the `python/` directory
- **Documentation** should be stored in the `docs/` directory
- **Scripts and utilities** should be stored in the `scripts/` directory

### Git Tracking Rules
- **ALWAYS track** all `.slx`, `.mdl`, and `.mat` files in Git
- **NEVER ignore** these critical model files
- Keep backup versions in appropriate archive directories
- Use descriptive commit messages for model changes

### Code Quality Standards

#### MATLAB Code
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for functions)
- Include proper error handling and input validation
- Add comments explaining complex algorithms
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow MATLAB best practices for performance

#### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Write unit tests for critical functions

### Model Development Guidelines
- Keep models modular and well-documented
- Use consistent parameter naming across models
- Document all assumptions and limitations
- Version control all model iterations
- Test models with known inputs before deployment

### Data Management
- Store large data files in appropriate subdirectories
- Use consistent naming conventions for data files
- Document data sources and processing steps
- Keep raw and processed data separate
- Use appropriate file formats for different data types

### Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document all major functions and scripts
- Include usage examples where appropriate
- Keep changelog updated
- Document model parameters and assumptions

### Testing and Validation
- Test all new functionality before committing
- Validate model outputs against known results
- Use appropriate testing frameworks
- Include test data in version control
- Document test procedures and expected results

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize code for large datasets
- Use vectorized operations where possible
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Consider parallel processing for heavy computations
- Document performance characteristics

### Security and Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive data or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use appropriate access controls

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feat/new-feature`, `fix/bug-description`)
- Write clear commit messages
- Review code before merging
- Communicate changes to team members
- Keep branches up to date with main

### Maintenance and Updates
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for deprecated functions
- Keep documentation current
- Archive old versions appropriately
