## 💾 What Was Preserved

### Code Analysis GUI Tool

**Source:** fix-matlab-error-flags branch
**Action:** ✅ Merged into main before deleting branch

**New files in main:**

```
matlab/Scripts/Code_Analysis_GUI/
├── README.md              - Documentation
├── codeIssuesGUI.m        - Interactive GUI (346 lines)
├── exportCodeIssues.m     - Core analysis engine
├── launchCodeAnalyzer.m   - Simple launcher (86 lines)
└── setup.m                - Setup script (83 lines)
```

**Usage:**

```matlab
cd matlab/Scripts/Code_Analysis_GUI
launchCodeAnalyzer()
```

**Features:**

- Interactive MATLAB code quality analysis
- Export results to CSV, Excel, JSON, or Markdown
- Self-contained tool for ongoing code quality work

## 📊 Cleanup Statistics

### Before Cleanup

- **Local branches:** 8
- **Remote branches:** 7
- **Total:** 15 branches

### After Cleanup

- **Local branches:** 2 (main + backup)
- **Remote branches:** 2 (main + backup)
- **Total:** 3 unique references (+ 1 tag)

## 🔐 Safety Verification

### Your Standalone Version is Safe

**Access via tag:**

```bash
git checkout v1.0-standalone
```

**Access via backup branch:**

```bash
git checkout backup/standalone-oct29-2025
```

**Return to main:**

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Code Analysis GUI is Preserved

**Location:** `matlab/Scripts/Code_Analysis_GUI/` in main branch
**Status:** ✅ Available for use
**No functionality lost!**

---

## 📝 What's in Main Now

### All Your Work

- ✅ Tabbed GUI framework
- ✅ Embedded SkeletonPlotter (Tab 3)
- ✅ Python smooth playback (60+ FPS)
- ✅ Python video export (720p-4K)
- ✅ MATLAB playback optimization (40 FPS)
- ✅ Signal plotter synchronization
- ✅ **Code Analysis GUI tool** (NEW!)

## 🧪 Testing the New Setup

### Test Tabbed GUI

```matlab
cd('matlab/Scripts/Golf_GUI')
launch_tabbed_app()
```

### Test Code Analysis GUI

```matlab
cd('matlab/Scripts/Code_Analysis_GUI')
launchCodeAnalyzer()
```

### Test Standalone SkeletonPlotter

```matlab
% Still works with original call
SkeletonPlotter(BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ)
```
