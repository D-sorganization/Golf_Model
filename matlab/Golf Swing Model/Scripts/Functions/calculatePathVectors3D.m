function [BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ] = calculatePathVectors3D(BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ)
% CALCULATEPATHVECTORS3D Computes 3D path vectors for Clubhead and Midpoint Hand.
%   [BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ] = CALCULATEPATHVECTORS3D(BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ)
%   calculates the 3D displacement vectors between consecutive time steps
%   for the Clubhead (CH) and Midpoint Hand (MP) based on their position
%   coordinates in the input tables. The calculated vectors (CHPx, CHPy,
%   CHPz, MPPx, MPPy, MPPz) are added as new columns to the respective tables.
%
%   This function operates on tables that are expected to be on a uniform
%   time grid, typically the 'Q' tables (BASEQ, ZTCFQ, DELTAQ).
%
%   Input:
%       BASEQ  - Table containing Base data on a uniform time grid,
%                including columns 'CHx', 'CHy', 'CHz', 'MPx', 'MPy', 'MPz'.
%       ZTCFQ  - Table containing ZTCF data on the same uniform time grid,
%                including columns 'CHx', 'CHy', 'CHz', 'MPx', 'MPy', 'MPz'.
%       DELTAQ - Table containing Delta data on the same uniform time grid,
%                including columns 'CHx', 'CHy', 'CHz', 'MPx', 'MPy', 'MPz'.
%
%   Output:
%       BASEQ  - Updated BASEQ table with added path vector columns.
%       ZTCFQ  - Updated ZTCFQ table with added path vector columns.
%       DELTAQ - Updated DELTAQ table with added path vector columns.
