Git Tag: SAFE_STATE_1956_COLUMNS_WORKING
Git Commit: 100f665

FEATURES:
- Stable data extraction with 1956 columns per trial
- Fixed 'finally' syntax error (replaced with proper MATLAB error handling)
- Improved GUI error handling for early termination
- Removed duplicate naming issues in Simulink model
- All functions restored and working properly
- Script backup system functional
- GUI reset functionality working

DATA CAPABILITIES:
- 1956 columns per trial successfully extracted
- All data types handled: scalars, vectors, matrices, time series
- Simscape data extraction working (Method 2 with direct access)
- CombinedSignalBus extraction functional
- Workspace outputs captured

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Robust error handling throughout GUI
- Graceful handling of early termination
- No more syntax errors from 'finally' blocks
- Clean GUI state management
- Proper cleanup on termination

FILES INCLUDED:
- All 56 .m files from main directory
- Complete GUI functionality
- All data extraction functions
- All utility and monitoring functions

RESTORATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy all .m files from this folder to the main Simulation_Dataset_GUI directory
2. Ensure all files are in the correct location: C:\Users\diete\Golf_Model\Golf Swing Model\Scripts\Simulation_Dataset_GUI
3. Run Data_GUI.m to start the GUI
4. Verify 1956 columns are extracted per trial

NOTES:
- This state represents a stable, working configuration
- All critical functions have been restored
- Error handling has been significantly improved
- Ready for production use with large datasets
