# Golf Swing Data Generator - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix issues and improve the golf swing data generation system.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY
**The actual working script is `Data_GUI.m` in the `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/` folder, NOT the `GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m` in the main directory.**

I was initially editing the wrong file. The correct working script has been identified and fixed.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 1x1 Matrix Signal Extraction Issue ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Problem**: The system was skipping 1x1 matrix signals (scalar values) like `MidpointCalcsLogs.signal7` and `RHCalcsLogs.signal2`.

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY FIXED** in the actual working script
- The `extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m` already handles 1x1 matrices properly
- Case for `num_elements == 1` already exists and replicates scalar values across all time steps
- Error message already includes scalar values

**Files**: `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m`

### 2. Animation Control Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Animation was always running in sequential mode, slowing down simulations. License doesn't support accelerator mode.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated `setModelParameters.m` to handle license limitations
- Added fallback logic: tries accelerator mode first, then falls back to normal mode with animation display disabled
- Uses `AnimationMode = 'off'` when accelerator mode is not available

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/setModelParameters.m`

### 3. File Location Confusion ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: I was editing the wrong file (`GolfSwingDataGeneratorGUI.m` in main directory instead of `Data_GUI.m` in Simulation_Dataset_GUI folder)

**Solution**:
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Identified the correct working script location
- ✅ **CLEANED UP**: Removed incorrect files from main directory
- ✅ **FIXED**: Applied fixes to the actual working script

**Correct Working Script**: `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/Data_GUI.m`

## Python Feature List
Created comprehensive machine learning feature list including all variables from the golf swing model:
- `golf_swing_ml_features.py` - Complete feature list for machine learning

## Summary
- ✅ Animation control now works with license limitations
- ✅ 1x1 matrix signals are properly captured (was already working)
- ✅ Correct working script identified and fixed
- ✅ Cleaned up incorrect files from main directory
- ✅ Comprehensive Python feature list created
