# Golf Swing Data Generator - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix issues and improve the golf swing data generation system.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY
**The actual working script is `Data_GUI.m` in the `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/` folder.**

All changes have been applied to the correct working script.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 1x1 Matrix Signal Extraction Issue ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Problem**: The system was skipping 1x1 matrix signals (scalar values) like `MidpointCalcsLogs.signal7` and `RHCalcsLogs.signal2`.

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY FIXED** in the actual working script
- The `extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m` already handles 1x1 matrices properly
- Case for `num_elements == 1` already exists and replicates scalar values across all time steps
- Error message already includes scalar values

**Files**: `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m`

### 2. Animation Control Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Animation was always running in sequential mode, slowing down simulations. License doesn't support accelerator mode.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated `setModelParameters.m` to handle license limitations
- Added fallback logic: tries accelerator mode first, then falls back to normal mode with animation display disabled
- Uses `AnimationMode = 'off'` when accelerator mode is not available

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/setModelParameters.m`

### 3. GUI Reset After Completion ✅ ADDED
**Problem**: System didn't reset to startup state after completing a batch, making it difficult to change parameters and run new batches.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **ADDED**: `resetGUItoStartupState()` function that restores GUI to initial startup state
- ✅ **REMOVED**: "Run Another Trial" button (not what was needed)
- System now resets after completion, allowing parameter changes and new batch runs
- All UI elements return to startup state
- Ready for new batch of tests immediately after completion

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/Data_GUI.m`

### 4. Enhanced Stop Button ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Stop button didn't actually stop running simulations.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Enhanced stop button to use `set_param(model_name, 'SimulationCommand', 'stop')`
- Added proper error handling for stop operations
- Improved UI state management
- Added parallel pool detection and cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/Data_GUI.m`

## New Features Added

### 1. Automatic Script Backup System ✅ ADDED
**Feature**: Automatically creates backup of all scripts before each run.

**Implementation**:
- `backupScripts()` function creates timestamped backup folders
- Backs up all 40+ supporting scripts in the Simulation_Dataset_GUI folder
- Creates README file with backup information
- Integrated into `startGeneration()` function

**Files Modified**:
- `Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/Data_GUI.m`

## File Organization ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Files were scattered in wrong locations.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **MOVED**: All files moved to correct `Simulation_Dataset_GUI` folder
- ✅ **ARCHIVED**: Incorrect files moved to `Archive` folder
- ✅ **ORGANIZED**: Proper file structure maintained

**Current Structure**:
```
Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI/
├── Data_GUI.m (MAIN WORKING SCRIPT)
├── setModelParameters.m (FIXED)
├── extractFromCombinedSignalBus.m (ALREADY WORKING)

## Python Feature List
Created comprehensive machine learning feature list including all variables from the golf swing model:
- `Archive/golf_swing_ml_features.py` - Complete feature list for machine learning

## Summary
- ✅ Animation control now works with license limitations
- ✅ 1x1 matrix signals are properly captured (was already working)
- ✅ GUI resets to startup state after completion for new batch runs
- ✅ Enhanced stop button with proper simulation stopping
- ✅ Automatic script backup system implemented
- ✅ All files properly organized in correct location
- ✅ Comprehensive Python feature list created

## How to Use

### Run the GUI:
```matlab
cd('Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI')
Data_GUI
```

### Test Animation Control:
```matlab
cd('Golf Swing Model/Scripts/Simulation_Dataset_GUI')
test_animation_fix
```

### Key Features:
1. **Animation Control**: Checkbox to enable/disable animation (default: disabled for speed)
2. **GUI Reset**: System automatically resets to startup state after completion
3. **Enhanced Stop**: Red button now actually stops running simulations
4. **Script Backup**: Automatic backup before each run in `Script_Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` folders
5. **1x1 Matrix Support**: All scalar signals now properly captured
