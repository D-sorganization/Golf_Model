# Parallel Pool Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The MATLAB GUI was consistently using only 6 parallel workers instead of the configured 14 workers with the Local_Cluster profile. This was causing performance to be limited despite having the correct cluster configuration.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `runParallelSimulations` function in `Data_GUI_Enhanced.m`. The function was hardcoded to use:

```matlab
parpool('local', num_workers);
```

This completely ignored the user preferences for:
- Cluster profile (`handles.preferences.cluster_profile`)
- Number of workers (`handles.preferences.max_parallel_workers`)

Instead, it was always using the default 'local' profile, which typically defaults to 6 workers.

## Solution Applied

Modified the `runParallelSimulations` function to properly use user preferences:

### Before (Problematic Code)
```matlab
% Start parallel pool with local profile
parpool('local', num_workers);
fprintf('Successfully started parallel pool with local profile (%d workers)\n', num_workers);
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```matlab
% Get cluster profile and worker count from user preferences
cluster_profile = getFieldOrDefault(handles.preferences, 'cluster_profile', 'Local_Cluster');
max_workers = getFieldOrDefault(handles.preferences, 'max_parallel_workers', 14);

% Ensure cluster profile exists
available_profiles = parallel.clusterProfiles();
if ~ismember(cluster_profile, available_profiles)
    fprintf('Warning: Cluster profile "%s" not found, falling back to Local_Cluster\n', cluster_profile);
    cluster_profile = 'Local_Cluster';
    % Ensure Local_Cluster exists
    if ~ismember(cluster_profile, available_profiles)
        fprintf('Local_Cluster not found, creating it...\n');
        try
            cluster = parallel.cluster.Local;
            cluster.Profile = 'Local_Cluster';
            cluster.saveProfile();
            fprintf('Local_Cluster profile created successfully\n');
        catch ME
            fprintf('Failed to create Local_Cluster profile: %s\n', ME.message);
            cluster_profile = 'local';
        end
    end
end

% Get cluster object
try
    cluster_obj = parcluster(cluster_profile);
    fprintf('Using cluster profile: %s\n', cluster_profile);
    
    % Check if cluster supports the requested number of workers
    if isfield(cluster_obj, 'NumWorkers') && cluster_obj.NumWorkers > 0
        cluster_max_workers = cluster_obj.NumWorkers;
        fprintf('Cluster supports max %d workers\n', cluster_max_workers);
        % Use the minimum of requested and cluster limit
        num_workers = min(max_workers, cluster_max_workers);
    else
        num_workers = max_workers;
    end
    
    fprintf('Starting parallel pool with %d workers using %s profile...\n', num_workers, cluster_profile);
    
    % Start parallel pool with specified cluster profile
    parpool(cluster_obj, num_workers);
    fprintf('Successfully started parallel pool with %s profile (%d workers)\n', cluster_profile, num_workers);
    
catch ME
    fprintf('Failed to use cluster profile %s: %s\n', cluster_profile, ME.message);
    fprintf('Falling back to local profile...\n');
    
    % Fallback to local profile
    temp_cluster = parcluster('local');
    fallback_workers = min(max_workers, temp_cluster.NumWorkers);
    parpool('local', fallback_workers);
    fprintf('Successfully started parallel pool with local profile (%d workers)\n', fallback_workers);
end
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Respects User Preferences**: Now uses the cluster profile and worker count from `handles.preferences`
2. **Automatic Profile Creation**: Creates Local_Cluster profile if it doesn't exist
3. **Proper Fallback**: Falls back to local profile only if the preferred cluster profile fails
4. **Worker Count Validation**: Respects both user preference and cluster limits
5. **Better Logging**: Provides clear feedback about which profile and worker count is being used

## Expected Results

After this fix:
- The GUI should use the Local_Cluster profile with 14 workers as configured
- Performance should improve significantly with the additional workers
- The cluster profile selection in the Performance Settings tab should work correctly
- User preferences should persist between GUI sessions

## Testing

A test script `test_parallel_pool_fix.m` has been created to verify:
- Local_Cluster profile availability
- Parallel pool creation with correct profile
- Worker count configuration
- Fallback behavior

## Files Modified

- `Data_GUI_Enhanced.m` - Fixed `runParallelSimulations` function

## Related Functions

- `getAvailableClusterProfiles()` - Ensures Local_Cluster is available
- `loadPerformancePreferencesToUI()` - Loads preferences into UI
- `savePerformanceSettings()` - Saves user preferences
- `initializeLocalCluster()` - Sets up Local_Cluster profile

## Verification Steps

1. Launch the GUI
2. Go to Performance Settings tab
3. Verify Local_Cluster is selected as cluster profile
4. Verify 14 workers is set as max parallel workers
5. Start a simulation
6. Check console output - should show "Using cluster profile: Local_Cluster"
7. Verify parallel pool is created with 14 workers
